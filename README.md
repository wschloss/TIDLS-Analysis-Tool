Senior Project - TIDLS Software


-------------------
Prototype tasks
-------------------

Complete:
- Basic user interaction
- Constants can be loaded from a text file
- Lifetime data can be loaded from a text file

Todo:
- All necessary equation definitions should be available for use
- Simulated lifetime data can be generated and exported to a text file
- Loaded data can be analyzed and data for tn0, k, and chi^2 is exported
	-many possible subtasks here

Known issues:
- When loading data after a previous set of constants/data were loaded
	in the same session, the previous data is flushed for the new
	set of constants/data.  This may be undesirable behavior in the
	future.
