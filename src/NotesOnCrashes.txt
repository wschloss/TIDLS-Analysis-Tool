The program works sometimes and crashes other times... 
If you run the full set of data, it's guaranteed to crash at some point. 
I ran a performance test, and, as expected, the majority of the time is 
taken running a chi2 fit... and there's 100 iterations for each temperature. 
Specifically, roughly 66% of the time is spent in fdjac2_ (part of the chi2
fitting), and 33% in Analyzer::fcn (the function that defines what we're doing
a chi2 fit to).

While debugging the program, I've gotten multiple errors. For some reason the
program hits a breakpoint right before "double kb = constants["kb"];" without a
reason. If I continue through this breakpoint, the debugger breaks again and
says a heap has been corrupted. I have no idea what that entails.

I can continue through that again and the program will begin running fits (ever so slowly).
I've gotten it to work with a small set of data, sometimes. The entire set of data in
"generatedData.txt" has crashed every time I try it... although it takes a long time to try.
I forgot the error that occurs when this crashes. I'm running it again while writing this,
so that I can include that in this .txt document when it crashes again. I do know that it
crashes during the fitting though (where the program spends most of its time anyway).

I'm hoping that you (Walter) can look over the code and get an idea on how to optimize my code.
I'm assuming it's memory leaks or something, but I really don't have any idea.
